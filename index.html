        <h2>About the Investment Club</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The Investment Club</strong> is a student-led organization dedicated to understanding the stock market, analyzing current events, and building financial literacy through real-world simulations and bi-weekly discussions.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We meet every other Wednesday at <strong>7:45 AM</strong> in <strong>Room 1423</strong>. Each meeting begins with an educational presentation to introduce and reinforce key investment concepts. We then examine current global events and their impact on financial markets—always maintaining a nonpartisan approach. Club members are encouraged to present their own trading ideas and potential stock picks to the group.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          As a team, we create and manage a simulated portfolio using the <strong>Investopedia</strong> paper trading platform, tracking and analyzing our collective performance. Additional events include a fantasy football-style investing competition, where members build individual portfolios and compete to maximize returns. The member with the lowest balance by the deadline will receive a fun, group-decided punishment—voted on via Google Forms.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We use platforms such as <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong> for market research and <strong>Investopedia</strong> for simulations. While members may choose to invest real money through services like <strong><a href="https://www.fidelity.com/go/youth-account/overview" style="color: #4bffb1;">Fidelity Teen Accounts</a></strong> (with parental supervision), any personal financial decisions are the sole responsibility of the member.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Our mission is to educate and empower—not to provide financial advice. Officer roles and a point-based system for graduation cords are in development. The club welcomes feedback through anonymous <strong><a href="#contact" style="color: #4bffb1;">Google Forms</a></strong> or in person.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          For any questions, feel free to reach out to <strong>Jacob Kirkpatrick</strong> (Founder), <strong>Colin Wilbanks</strong> (Founder), or <strong>Mr. Erwin</strong> (Club Sponsor) using the information in the <strong><a href="#contact" style="color: #4bffb1;">Contact Us</a></strong> section.
